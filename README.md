# Hayat Alghamdi - Computer Science Portfolio

A modern, responsive practice portfolio website created as an assignment to demonstrate web development skills. This project showcases fundamental HTML, CSS, and JavaScript capabilities along with AI-assisted development techniques.

## Project Description

This portfolio website serves as a comprehensive digital resume, featuring:

- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
- **Interactive Navigation**: Smooth scrolling between sections with active link highlighting
- **Skills Showcase**: Visual representation of technical skills including Java, Python, C, SQL, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, React, Git, GitHub, and Figma
- **Project Portfolio**: Detailed showcase of academic and personal projects including AI models, tutoring platforms, and data analysis work
- **Contact Integration**: Functional contact form with Formspree integration for direct communication
- **Modern UI/UX**: Clean, professional design with smooth animations and accessibility features

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- A local web server (optional, for better development experience)

### Running the Website Locally

#### Option 1: Direct File Opening
1. Clone or download the project files to your local machine
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Open `index.html` directly in your web browser

#### Option 2: Using a Local Web Server
For the best development experience and to avoid any CORS issues:

**Using Python (if installed):**
```bash
cd /path/to/project
python -m http.server 8000
```
Then open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser

**Using Node.js (if installed):**
```bash
cd /path/to/project
npx serve .
```
Then open the provided localhost URL in your browser

**Using PHP (if installed):**
```bash
cd /path/to/project
php -S localhost:8000
```
Then open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser

#### Option 3: Live Server (VS Code Extension)
1. Install the "Live Server" extension in VS Code
2. Right-click on `index.html` and select "Open with Live Server"
3. The website will automatically open in your default browser

## AI Usage Summary

This project demonstrates the effective integration of AI assistance in web development. Starting with basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, AI tools were used to enhance programming capabilities and implement sophisticated features including:

### Key AI Contributions
- **Code Structure & Architecture**: Generated foundational HTML, CSS, and JavaScript structures
- **Advanced Styling**: Implemented CSS Grid, Flexbox, custom properties, and responsive design patterns
- **Interactive Features**: Built form validation, navigation systems, and scroll-triggered animations
- **Performance Optimization**: Applied best practices for event handling and browser compatibility

### Learning Enhancement
AI assistance accelerated the learning process by exposing the developer to advanced web development concepts beyond basic skill levels. The project showcases how AI can bridge the gap between foundational knowledge and professional-grade implementation.
